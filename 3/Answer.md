# What problem does Virtualization solves and what is its drawback in context to modern application deployments?

    Efficiency of resources and costs
    Organizations use virtualization to host multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single server. Assume a company wishes to deploy a number of applications. Instead of purchasing additional servers, they can deploy VMs on a single server for each application, achieving the same result at a fraction of the cost. This improves cost-efficiency because the physical hardware is used to its full potential.

    Scalability
    Adding a virtual machine is as simple as cloning copies of existing virtual machines on the physical machine. Organizations are better able to respond to fluctuations in load, which helps to stabilize performance. When compared to installing different operating systems on physical servers, this is faster and more efficient.

    Security
    Because VM environments are isolated from the host operating system, vulnerabilities such as malware have no impact on the underlying hardware. As a result, virtual machines are ideal for testing new applications or software changes before they go live.

    A compromised VM can be easily rolled back to a previous version. It can also be quickly deleted and recreated to expedite disaster recovery.

> When you wish to run many apps on a server or have a large selection of operating systems to handle, virtual machines are ideal for supporting applications that demand complete functionality of an operating system.
Virtualization enables residual processes to continue to function in situations where they are separated from their basic equipment by a layer of reflection. This reflection allows servers to be partitioned into virtual machines (VMs) that can run different operating systems.




> Containerization and virtualization differ in many ways, but the main distinction is that containers allow you to virtualize an operating system and run various workloads in a single OS instance. The hardware is virtualized with VMs in order to run multiple OS instances. The container's speed, agility, and portability offer it yet another tool for streamlining software development.

Container innovation offers an alternative technique for virtualization, in which a single functioning framework on a host may run a large number of cloud users.
